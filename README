Qiosko is a app for rss reading.

Right now only read a preset list of RSS feeds, but the idea is to be able to manage that feed list to add more or delete. This is only a child!

ToDo:

Add manage system to add or delete feed for the local list.
Add support to Google reader (login on your account and read yours RSS on Qiosko)
